# Code Refactor
The codebase has been meticulously refactored to adhere to accessibility standards, making the web content inclusive and accessible to users with disabilities. Additionally, the CSS selectors have been intelligently consolidated to achieve a codebase that is not only clean and elegant but also highly readable and maintainable. Here's an improved breakdown of the key aspects of the enhanced codebase:
## A codebase that follows accessibility standards
* Semantic HTML elements.
* The elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
* Accessible alt attributes.
* Headings in sequential order.
* The title element has a concise, descriptive title.
* Consolidating CSS selectors and properties.
* Organizing CSS to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements.
* Comments before each element or section of the page.
*
